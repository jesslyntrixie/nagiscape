## About The Project

Nagiscape is a full-stack web application that allows users to create their perfect sound environment. Whether for studying, working, or sleeping, you can mix and match high-quality music tracks with a variety of ambient sounds like rain, fireplaces, and ocean waves. Logged-in users can save their favorite combinations as custom "mixes" to easily access them later.

This project was built from scratch to demonstrate a complete full-stack development cycle, from backend API creation to a dynamic, interactive React frontend.


## Key Features

* **Dynamic Audio Player:** Play a curated list of music tracks and mix multiple ambient sounds simultaneously.
* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration with email verification, login, and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Save & Load Mixes:** Logged-in users can save their custom sound configurations (active track, ambience volumes) and load them in future sessions.
* **User Account Management:** A dedicated settings page where users can change their password or securely delete their account.
* **Forgot/Reset Password:** Complete email-based password reset functionality.
* **Modern UI:** A responsive, glassmorphism-style interface with a looping video background for an immersive experience.
